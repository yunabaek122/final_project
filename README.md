*Project Description* 
For our final project for the Harris course, Data Programming in Python II, we created a Shiny dashboard to allow 
users to toggle between different demographic, environmental, and geographic characteristics of Washington DC against 
a visual backdrop map of the city, its co-ed cooling centers, and wards. The purpose of the project was to investigate 
whether existing cooling centers in DC equitably meet the needs of its residents and protect resident subgroups (i.e. 
low-income residents, elderly population, etc.) who are disproportionately impacted by extreme heat. 
We drew upon existing heat index and heat sensitivity maps and their datasets, and cooling center data. 

*Background* 
As temperatures rise, US cities will experience extreme heat and a need to protect their residents under
these conditions. Cities often face an “Urban Heat Island Effect” where man made structures and a lack
of trees and vegetation, make urban regions hotter than the suburbs (Keep Cool DC, 2022). Many cities
employ the use of cooling centers, which are air-conditioned publicly accessible buildings, in their
extreme heat adaptation strategies. According to one study Washington DC ranked highest in
accessibility among 81 US cities (Adams et al 2023). DC has experienced rising temperatures at nearly
an entire degree per decade and expects the number of heat days to triple by 2050 (Keep Cool DC,
2022). Their current strategy activates cooling centers when the heat index reaches 95℉ and they have
137 centers across the city.

*Policy Implications of Findings* 
Adverse Health Impacts: There is significant correlation between regions that have a high percent of
adults with asthma and a higher heat sensitivity index (HSI) (Wards 7 and 8) but not many specialized cooling centers for
populations that would be disproportionately impacted by heat-related health conditions. Elderly people
are amongst the most vulnerable to effects of extreme heat but also struggle to perceive that they are
(Bedi et al 2023). Cooling centers therefore not only act as centers of refuge but also can be
preventative vehicles of health safety and education for vulnerable populations.

Infrastructure: The static plot comparison between Heat Exposure Index (HEI) and Low-Income populations across the city
reveal that Wards 7 and 8 with the highest percent of low-income residents have moderate HEI. Despite
this, the HSI for these wards are the highest which is cause for concern and may suggest opportunity
for new green infrastructure developments that reduces the HEI. For example, covered bus stations or
private properties such as malls or coffee shops which residents already turn to for cooling needs.

Vulnerable Populations: The static plot of the elderly population across the city with senior wellness
centers overlaid reveals less than adequate coverage of these specialized centers by high density
regions. In some cases there are public libraries available beside these regions which makes it difficult
to determine whether these specialized cooling centers are being used effectively, whether other
cooling centers can be considered substitutes, and whether more specialized centers should be
established or not.
